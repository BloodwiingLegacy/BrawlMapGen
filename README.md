# BrawlMapGen [Optimized]
A generator which takes arrays of strings and tiles with vector graphics to make generated map images of any size.

WARNING: This build is in a separate branch because of it's unfinished unstability. Bugs and crashes to be expected. Do not use for map making, but bug testing is always appreciated :smile:. 

## Usage
You can use the built versions in `/builds/` or build the program yourself using a compiler like visual studio.
Before opening the built app, edit the `options.json` file found in the root of the build folder, it specifies the biome, gamemode and describes the map itself. The generator doesn't wait at all and begins to work almost immediatelly.

You can find documentation on the `options.json` file [here](https://github.com/thedonciuxx/BrawlMapGen/wiki/Options.json-explained).
